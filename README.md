# flutter-Counter-App
<br>
This is a tweaked version of the counter app which comes as a starter project when we open up flutter on our editor. Feel Free to make or suggest any changed.
<br>
This project has a slightly different layout than the usual starter application.
<br>
It comes with a reset and a decrement button. Furthermore, I have added a snackbar so when a user tries to reset the counter when already at 0, the snackbar pops up with a message. Similar behaviour can be seen when someone tries to decrement it beyond zero(Although the message is slightly different.) You can see the images below for reference.
